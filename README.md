# React and WCF Service Application - A 3 tier e-commerce platform

## Description
### What is it:
This project is a website called Quick Kart.
Quick Kart is an online grocery shopping platform that simplifies meal 
planning and grocery shopping for users. In addition to the standard online 
grocery shopping features, Quick Kart allows users to select from a curated list 
of recipes. Upon selecting a recipe, the system automatically adds all necessary 
ingredients to the user's shopping cart. This feature saves time, reduces food 
waste, and enhances the user experience by making meal planning and grocery 
shopping seamless and efficient.

### Why was it built:
This was a project built in order to learn more about how a 3-tier system works. 
This project was to learn web technologies using React as well as what does into 
building an backend to do all the processes.
This was built for a group project for a University module to learn how to collaborate
with team members to develop a 3-tier system.
